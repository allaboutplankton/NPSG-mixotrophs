# NPSG-mixotrophs
Hi! Welcome to the NPSG mixotrophs project. Phylogenetically and functionally diverse, small mixotrophic flagellates were isolated from the north Pacific subtropical gyre and studied by the MarVEL Team at University of Hawai'i (website link https://sites.google.com/view/marvels-at-uh/home).
In this project, you can find data files of summarized isolation and taxonomy information of all 39 grazers (table formats), the 18S rRNA phylogeny (near-full length sequence alignments), grazing parameters compasion across strains and genera (i.e. clearance rate, body volume clearance rate and growth efficiency), 18S rRNA gene copy and cell abundance in situ including gene copy numbers per cell estimates (all in excel data sheets), genus/clade-specific qPCR primers, as well as R scripts for plotting functional grazing response curves (including experimental results in csv file) and global distribution map using Tara Ocean 18S rRNA metabarcode database.
