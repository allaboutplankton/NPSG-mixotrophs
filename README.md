# NPSG-mixotrophs
Phylogenetically and functionally diverse mixotrophic flagellates were isolated from the north Pacific subtropical gyre and studied through both lab experiments and field measurements.
In this project, you can find source data files of summarized isolation and taxonomy information of all 39 grazers, the 18S rRNA phylogeny (near-full length sequence alignments), grazing parameters (clearance rate, specific clearance rate, and growth efficiency), 18S rRNA gene copy and cell abundance in situ NPSG, estimated gene copy numbers per cell, genus/clade-specific qPCR primers, and R scripts for fitting functional responses and mapping global distributions using the Tara Oceans 18S rRNA metabarcode database.
