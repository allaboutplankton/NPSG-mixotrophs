# NPSG-mixotrophs
Phylogenetically and functionally diverse, small mixotrophic flagellates were isolated from the north Pacific subtropical gyre and studied through both lab experiments and field measurements.
In this project, you can find data files of summarized isolation and taxonomy information of all 39 grazers (table format), the 18S rRNA phylogeny (near-full length sequence alignments), grazing parameters comparision across strains and genera (i.e. clearance rate, body volume clearance rate and growth efficiency), 18S rRNA gene copy and cell abundance in situ NPSG, gene copy numbers per cell estimates based on various cultures (all in excel format), genus/clade-specific qPCR primers, as well as R scripts for plotting functional grazing response curves (including experimental results in csv file) and global distribution map using Tara Ocean 18S rRNA metabarcode database.
